Level 0

% Level Goal %
    The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need
    to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the
    password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

    The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory.
    Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use
    SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

% Solution %
  $ ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
     -p port
         Port to connect to on the remote host.  This can be specified on a per-host basis in the
         configuration file.
